// ==== Challenge 1: Write your own closure ====
// Write a simple closure of your own creation.  Keep it simple!



// ==== Challenge 2: Flip A Coin ====
 
   // Use the function below flip(), give it one parameter called "repeat" and make it so that every time we call it and give it a number, it flips a coin and gives us "Heads" or "Tails"
   // Use Math.round(Math.random()) inside the function to generate a random number, which will be the coin flip
   // Use for loop inside the function to repeat the process of flipping the coin
   // always return "Heads" or "Tails" and log your result on the console.

    function flip(repeat){
        // Your code goes here
    }

// ==== Challenge 2: Create a counter function ====
const counter = () => {
    // Return a function that when invoked increments and returns a counter variable.
  };
  // Example usage: const newCounter = counter();
  // newCounter(); // 1
  // newCounter(); // 2
  
  // ==== Challenge 3: Create a counter function with an object that can increment and decrement ====
  const counterFactory = () => {
    // Return an object that has two methods called `increment` and `decrement`.
    // `increment` should increment a counter variable in closure scope and return it.
    // `decrement` should decrement the counter variable and return it.
  };
